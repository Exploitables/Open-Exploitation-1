### Open-Exploitation-1
 For those who want to get an idea of what EXP-301 is about. This is NOT an official course.

### Disclaimer
 I will not upload any files to this repository until I have confirmed permission to create this. While this repository will be based on the [EXP-301 course syllabus](https://www.offensive-security.com/documentation/EXP301-syllabus.pdf), this will NOT closely represent the course and its teachings (for obvious reasons). Rather, this repository will teach users of the same concepts, utilizing different case studies.

 This repository, by design, is to provide those who are interested in the EXP-301 course offered by Offensive Security, and to provide those who are taking the course with some alternative exercises to strengthen their knowledge.

 Lastly, this repository will update **only** if the original course material is updated **and** I have been granted permission to update this repository. If new exploit development methodologies and concepts are introduced into the course, I will update this repository accordingly as necessary. The material provided in this repository may be incomplete or inaccurate. Please create issues accordingly if you notice any problems.

# Chapter 1: Windows User Mode Exploit Development: General Course Information

### Chapter 1.1: About the Open Exploitation 1 Course
 The course that you are reading currently is not the [official EXP-301 course](https://www.offensive-security.com/exp301-osed/). Rather, this is an open-sourced version of the course that does not use any course material from [Offensive Security](https://www.offensive-security.com/). In this course (and EXP-301), you will learn the fundamentals of reverse engineering, the creation of custom exploits, the skills required to bypass legacy and modern exploit mitigations (Data Execution Prevention/Address Space Layout Randomization), the writing of hand-made Windows shellcode and assembly code, and the ability to adapt older techniques to function on modern versions of Windows. To begin, we suggest that you have prior familiarity with debuggers (WinDbg, ImmunityDbg, OllyDbg), prior familiarity with basic, 32-bit exploitation concepts, prior familiarity with writing Python 3 code (for this course, Python 2 works as well), the ability to read C code at a basic level (highly recommended), and the ability to read and understand 32-bit x86 assembly code at a basic level (also highly recommended).

# Chapter 1.2: Provided Materials
 
### Chapter 1.2.1: Open Exploitation 1 Course Materials
 In this course, the materials that are provided to you are via this repository in the [Course Materials](https://github.com/Exploitables/Open-Exploitation-1/tree/main/Course%20Materials). The course exercises and the course lab machines can also be found in the [Course Materials](https://github.com/Exploitables/Open-Exploitation-1/tree/main/Course%20Materials) directory. In terms of the course content, all of the course content can be found on the README file [here](https://github.com/Exploitables/Open-Exploitation-1/).

### Chapter 1.2.2: Access to the Lab Network
 As covered in the previous sub-chapter, the lab machines can be found in the [Course Materials](https://github.com/Exploitables/Open-Exploitation-1/tree/main/Course%20Materials) directory. Each lab machine will require you to manually set it up on your host machine. As these lab machines were created on [VMware Workstation Pro](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-pro/workstation-pro-evaluation.html), ensure that you have a copy of the program to properly load the virtual machine images. We do not have a VPN for lab access in this course.

### Chapter 1.2.3: The Offensive Security Student Forum
 If you have purchased the [official EXP-301 course](https://www.offensive-security.com/exp301-osed/), you may refer to the [Offensive Security Student Forums](https://forums.offensive-security.com/) for reference. However, you cannot ask questions regarding Open Exploitation 1 on these forums.
