### Open-Exploitation-1
 For those who want to get an idea of what EXP-301 is about. This is NOT an official course.

### Disclaimer
 I will not upload any files to this repository until I have confirmed permission to create this. While this repository will be based on the [EXP-301 course syllabus](https://www.offensive-security.com/documentation/EXP301-syllabus.pdf), this will NOT closely represent the course and its teachings (for obvious reasons). Rather, this repository will teach users of the same concepts, utilizing different case studies.

 This repository, by design, is to provide those who are interested in the EXP-301 course offered by Offensive Security, and to provide those who are taking the course with some alternative exercises to strengthen their knowledge.

 Lastly, this repository will update **only** if the original course material is updated **and** I have been granted permission to update this repository. If new exploit development methodologies and concepts are introduced into the course, I will update this repository accordingly as necessary. The material provided in this repository may be incomplete or inaccurate. Please create issues accordingly if you notice any problems.

### Chapter 1.1: About the Open Exploitation 1 Course
 The course that you are reading currently is not the [official EXP-301 course](https://www.offensive-security.com/exp301-osed/). Rather, this is an open-sourced version of the course that does not use any course material from [Offensive Security](https://www.offensive-security.com/). In this course (and EXP-301), you will learn the fundamentals of reverse engineering, the creation of custom exploits, the skills required to bypass legacy and modern exploit mitigations (Data Execution Prevention/Address Space Layout Randomization), the writing of hand-made Windows shellcode and assembly code, and the ability to adapt older techniques to function on modern versions of Windows. To begin, we suggest that you have prior familiarity with debuggers (WinDbg, ImmunityDbg, OllyDbg), prior familiarity with basic, 32-bit exploitation concepts, prior familiarity with writing Python 3 code (for this course, Python 2 works as well), the ability to read C code at a basic level (highly recommended), and the ability to read and understand 32-bit x86 assembly code at a basic level (also highly recommended).
