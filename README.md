# Open-EXP-301
 For those who want to get an idea of what EXP-301 is about. This is NOT the official course.

# Disclaimer
 I will not upload any files to this repository until I have confirmed permission to create this. While this repository will be based on the EXP-301 course syllabus, this will NOT closely represent the course and its teachings (for obvious reasons). Rather, this repository will teach users of the same concepts, utilizing different case studies.
 
 This repository, by design, is to provide those who are interested in the EXP-301 course offered by Offensive Security, and to provide those who are taking the course with some alternative exercises to strengthen their knowledge.
